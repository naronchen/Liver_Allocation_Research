# Liver-Allocation-Project

# Basic Design:

# Best Algorithm at preventing deaths so far: 
Basic Greedy

# Flaws:

Expectation Greedy: Biases toward hospitals with larger 

# Assumptions to be checked/clarified:

Mortality rates

Deaths from life

MELD score death distribution

Data from online reports

Inclusion/Exclusion of Status 1A/1B

Inclusion/Exclusion of Share 15/Share 35

MELD score generation

Poisson Proccess as a model for data

MELD Score progression

Acceptance Rejection of donations

# Theory:

Potential trade off between deaths and regional equality - to be checked by LivSim statistics
